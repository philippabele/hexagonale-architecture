# Lab 1 Clean Architecture Pattern, Modularization, SOLID and Domain Modules

## General Information

Please follow the package, class, and method names as described in the exercises.

## Clean Architecture Pattern and Underlying Design Principles

### Clean Architecture Pattern

Look at ring model of the clean architecture pattern. Try to understand the fundamental separation of the domain and the
infrastructure.

![Ring model of the clean architecture pattern](../img/clean-architecture.png)

**True or false?**

1. The infrastructure provides interfaces which the domain can implement.
2. Adapter implementations (also known as adapters) are located within the infrastructure ring and are responsible to integrate
   and access infrastructure components (e.g. file system, http in- and outbound).
3. The domain only depends on use cases located in the use case ring.
4. The domain provides interfaces which will be implemented by adapters.
5. Use case definitions are driven by adapters.
6. The use case ring connects the infrastructure and the domain.
7. Use case definitions are driven by domain.

### Common Closure and Separation of Concerns

The _common closure principles_ says:

---
_The classes of a package should be closed together against the same kind of changes. A change that affects a package
affects all the classes in that package and no other package._

Some people also say that the _common closure principle_ describes the _single responsibility principle_ for packages.
The reason is that the same kind of changes is in most cases related to functional or domain-related requirements.

The conclusion is that the package should be sliced vertically by domain object and functions (e.g. _vehicle_ or _vehicle data management_) and not
horizontally by technical characteristics (e.g. _controller_ or _services_). There is another principle, the so-called 
_separation of concerns_, which describes the same idea.

_Separation of concerns_:

---
Separate different aspects of a problem and manage every sub-problem on its own. Based on this create semantical chunks,
so that the complexity of each chunk can be handled easier.

### Single Responsibility and SOLID

The single responsibility principle says:

---
_There should never be more than one reason for a class to change!_ 

_-Tom DeMarco & Meilir Page-Jones_


In comparison to the common closure principle and separation of concerns, which affects the package level, the single
responsibility principle affects the class level.

This is also the case for the other principles of SOLID. SOLID stands for

* **single responsibility principle**
* open closed principle
* liskov substitution principle
* **interface segregation principle**
* **dependency inversion principle**

During the training, we discuss the principles highlighted in bold and also some others that not belongs to SOLID
directly.

An associated goal is to separate technical and domain-related aspects within the common closure ( or in other words the _domain module_). This
could be reached by class-stereotypes containing a clear task, that this stereotype has to do. For the clean
architecture pattern class-stereotypes can look like follows:

![Class stereotypes of clean architecture pattern](../img/stereotypes-within-common-closure.png)

We will meet all class-stereotype step by step.

## Package Structure Variants Within Clean Architecture Pattern

In the first step, you have to decide which package style you want to use.

There are several package structure variants, that can be applied within the clean architecture pattern:

* architectural expressive
* architectural expressive domain
* rings by layers

The recommendation is to use **architectural expressive**. Because layers are something you are more familiar with and
in this variant the concepts of clean architecture pattern will become more visible to you.

### Rings as Layers

The _domain module_ is structured simple according to the rings of the clean architecture pattern.

![Package structure variant rings as layers](../img/rings-as-layers.png)

### Architectural Expressive Domain

In this variant the _use case ring_ is separated in incoming (_in_) and outgoing (_out_) use cases. Addtionalliy, the _domain ring_ is
separared in _service_ and _model_.

![Package structure variant architectural expressive domain](../img/architectural-expressive-domain.png)

### Architectural Expressive

In this package structure variant the adapter ring is also structured according to the semantics of _in_ and _out_.

## The Domain Ring

### Task 1.1: Implement a Self-Validating Domain Model

1. Create the root entity <i>Vehicle</i> and place it in the designated package
2. Create the value object <i>Vin</i> and place it in the designated package
3. Ensure that the <i>Vehicle</i> can only be created with a valid vehicle identification number (vin)
4. Override equals, so that the Vehicle is the same object when the VIN is the same
5. A vehicle identification number is valid when the value follows the regex pattern below. Throw an
   IllegalStateException in case of a validations error.

**Java & Kotlin**

```java

// examples
// WP0ZZZ99ZTS392155
// WBAOLZ99ZTS349156

"(?=.*\\d|=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[A-Z])[A-Z0-9]{17}"

```

**C#**

```java

// examples
// WP0ZZZ99ZTS392155
// WBAOLZ99ZTS349156

"(?=.*\d|=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[A-Z])[A-Z0-9]{17}"

```

#### Verify your Implementation

The project comes with a first architecture test. Additionally, the tutorials' folder contains unit test for each coding
task.

Copy the unit test and after implementing a task to the prepared test folder structure, build the project and run the tests.
Fix the implementation when neccessary.

In test folder of the project there is a prepared package structure. In  are prepared architecture tests for each lab. 
Addtionally there are unit tests in _tutorial/lab/<number>_.

You can check four implementations by copying the unit tests
to the source folder, add the test to the classpath, and run the test.

**RUN** _DomainRing_Task_1_1_

#### Verify your Architecture

**RUN** _ArchitectureTest_Task_1_1_ 

### Task 1.2: Create the (Domain) Service for the Root Entity

1. Create the (domain) service <i>VehicleService</i> and place it in the designated package
2. The <i>VehicleService</i> should offer following method

**Java**

```java

public Vehicle findByVin(Vin vin){...}

```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin

fun Vehicle findByVin(Vin vin){...}

```

**C#**

```java

public VehicleRootEntity FindByVin(Vin vin){...}

```

Currently, it is enough to return a hard-coded instance of the class <i>Vehicle</i>.
Use this VIN: WP0ZZZ99ZTS392155

#### Verify your Implementation

#### Verify your Architecture

**RUN** _ArchitectureTest_Task_1_2_

### Task 1.3 [Optional]: Meet domainprimitives-java

Have a look at [domainprimitives-java](https://github.com/domain-primitives/domain-primitives-java) and compare it to
the native approach you implemented.

If you want, adapt your implementation. There are all dependencies you need already configured in the pom.xml. Or use
the following declaration:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.domain-primitives</groupId>
    <artifactId>domainprimitives-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The idea is not unqiue. There are several similiar libraries, like

* https://github.com/albertattard/domain-primitives-api or
* https://github.com/prashantbasawa/simple-validation-framework
* etc.

Please notice: There are not evaluated and used from my side.

It exist also concepts in the [java and spring ecosystem](https://reflectoring.io/bean-validation-with-spring-boot/)
for implementing self-validating domain objects.

#### For Kotlin Coders

There origin idea of [domainprimitives-java](https://github.com/domain-primitives/domain-primitives-java) is based on
Stefan
Ludwig's [comparison of strongly typed validation and javax validation](https://github.com/slu-it/technology-examples/tree/master/strongly-typed-vs-javax-validation)
written in kotlin.

For more details have a look
into [the domain object Age with native self-validation](https://github.com/slu-it/technology-examples/blob/master/strongly-typed-vs-javax-validation/src/main/kotlin/example/stronglytyped/model/Age.kt)
as well as
into [the domain object Age with self-validation based on a DSL](https://github.com/slu-it/technology-examples/blob/master/strongly-typed-vs-javax-validation/src/main/kotlin/example/stronglytypedwithdsl/model/Age.kt)
.

Look at
the [validation DSL](https://github.com/slu-it/technology-examples/blob/master/strongly-typed-vs-javax-validation/src/main/kotlin/example/stronglytypedwithdsl/validation/dsl.kt)

Seems this for you a good alternative approach to your native validation? If you like, adapt your
implementation, but consider the time.

#### For C# Coders

Do you know similiar approaches like _domainprimitives-java_? Discuss this in a _Breakout Room_ and maybe used this
in your implementation.
